# ðŸš€ Flutter Folder Structure Helper â€” Supercharge Your Flutter Workflow in VS Code

### Setting up a Flutter project structure can feel like riding a bike uphill â€” repetitive, slow, and often frustrating. Now imagine attaching a booster to that bike and flying up the hill. Thatâ€™s exactly what Flutter Folder Structure Helper does for your development workflow.

### This lightweight yet powerful VS Code extension helps you create a clean, scalable folder structure in seconds. With just one command, you can scaffold a complete Flutter project layout that includes state management (Provider), local storage with SharedPreferences, theme configuration, a splash screen setup, and more â€” all following best practices. No more wasting time manually creating folders and boilerplate files.

### But it doesnâ€™t stop there. This extension also gives you right-click context options to generate Stateless, Stateful, or even Stateful widgets with lifecycle methods like initState() and dispose(). You can also instantly create Provider classes with a single click, or package your project into a ZIP file for easy sharing.

### Flutter Folder Structure Helper is the toolkit every VS Code-based Flutter developer needs. Itâ€™s designed to save you time, reduce clutter, and help you focus on what matters most â€” building great apps.
